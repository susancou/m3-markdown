# Exercise-2

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

##this is heading 2
###ordered list
an ordered list is important when you are ranking your list - if, for example, you have a series of step that you want your user to do in a set order.  
  1. you would do this first
  1. you would do this second
  

#start
or you can really read the exercise and do a command..
##importance
I want to use open or read or something besides _start_ to open a file.
